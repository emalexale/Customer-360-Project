Customer 360 Dashboard

Business Problem
A financial services organization needed a unified view of customer segmentation, demographics, and behavior to support strategic planning and personalized engagement.

Solution
I built an interactive dashboard using data extracted from the Customer 360 database via SQL queries. The dashboard visualizes:

Customer segments and churn risk

Demographics (age, gender, location)

Lifetime value and engagement status

PEP status and customer type

Tools Used
SQL – for data extraction and transformation

Power BI – for dashboard design and visualization

Excel – for intermediate data cleaning (if needed)

Outcome
Provided management with actionable insights into customer behavior

Enabled targeted marketing and retention strategies

Reduced manual reporting time and improved data accuracy
